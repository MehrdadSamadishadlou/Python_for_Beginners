# The First Project

Write a program that can play the following game with a computer.

The steps of the game are as follows:

First, the user selects a number between 1 and 99 and does not tell the computer (does not input the number).

The program is executed.

The program guesses and prints a number.

The printed number creates three possible scenarios:

1. The guessed number is larger than the user's secret number. The user types 's' to indicate their number is smaller. The program should guess a smaller number than its previous guess to end the game faster.

2. The guessed number is smaller than the user's secret number. The user types 'l' to indicate their number is larger. The program should guess a larger number than its previous guess to end the game faster.

3. The guessed number matches the user's secret number. The user types 'c' to indicate the program guessed correctly and the game ends.


In summary, the user selects a secret number. The program tries to guess it. Based on the user's input after each guess, the program adjusts its next guess to be smaller or larger number, until eventually guessing correctly.
