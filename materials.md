An IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, is a software application that provides a comprehensive environment for programmers to write, edit, and debug code. Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is a popular and powerful IDE developed by Microsoft that supports various programming languages and platforms. I recommend using VSCode as your primary IDE for Python programming tasks. Download VSCode for free from the official website at the following link (Unfortunately, you may use an anti-filter for downloading this):

### Online Python programming

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
To fully immerse yourself in learning Python, it is highly recommended that you install Python on your computer. However, if you do not have access to a computer with Python installed, you can still explore the language using online platforms such as Google Colab or online-python, which can execute Python code.
