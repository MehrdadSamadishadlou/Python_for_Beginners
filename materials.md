## Python Environment

### Installing Python

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
If you haven't installed Python on your computer yet, you can download it for free from the official Python website. Simply follow this link to the download page:

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
An IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, is a software application that provides a comprehensive environment for programmers to write, edit, and debug code. Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is a popular and powerful IDE developed by Microsoft that supports various programming languages and platforms. I recommend using VSCode as your primary IDE for Python programming tasks. Download VSCode for free from the official website at the following link (Unfortunately, you may use an anti-filter for downloading this):

### Online Python programming

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
To fully immerse yourself in learning Python, it is highly recommended that you install Python on your computer. However, if you do not have access to a computer with Python installed, you can still explore the language using online platforms such as Google Colab or online-python, which can execute Python code.

## Python Reserved Words

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Python reserved keywords are words that have special meanings and purposes in the Python programming language. These keywords cannot be used as variable names, function names, or any other identifiers because they are already reserved for specific programming constructs. Here is the full list of Python reserved keywords:
</p>

```
and     continue  finally  is        raise
as      def       for      lambda    return
assert  del       from     None      True
async   elif      global   nonlocal  try
await   else      if       not       while
break   except    import   or        with
class   False     in       pass      yield
```
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
It can be useful to keep this list of Python reserved keywords handy. If you encounter an error message from the interpreter related to a variable name, you can quickly check if the variable name is a reserved keyword by referring to this list.
