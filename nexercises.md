> **IMPORTANT**  
> Large language models like ChatGPT can be highly useful, but relying on them to solve exercises can significantly hinder your learning process. Therefore, please refrain from using them to directly solve exercises. Instead, try to solve the exercises on your own first. Once you have attempted to solve them, you can ask the models for their solutions and compare them to your own. This way, you can identify areas where they wrote better codes and learn from them.


# 1. First Session

1. What is the output of each line of code? 

```
4 ** 3
42 // 12
17 % 6
print('b'*2 + 'a'*1 + 'c'*3 )
```

2. What would the following code print?

      ```
      x = 5
      x = x + 1
      x = 5 * 2
      x * 3
      print( x )
      ```

3. Write a program that utilizes the input function to ask the user for their name, then deliver a personalized welcome message as follows.

      ```
      Enter your name: Mehrdad
      Hello Mehrdad
      ```

4. Write a program that uses the input function to ask the user for the number of hours he/she worked and the hourly payment, and then calculate the gross pay based on this information.

      ```
      Work Hours: 32
      Hourly payment: 100000
      Pay: 3200000
      ```
5. If we are sure that the variable 'num' is a two-digit number, which line of code would cause the output to be the reverse of the value of 'num'? (For example, if 'var' equals 23, the output would be 32.)

      a. `print( str(var // 10) + str(var % 10) )`
      
      b. `print( str(var % 10) + str(var // 10) )`
      
      c.`print( str(var / 10) + str(var % 10) )` 
      
      d.`print( str(var % 10) + str(var / 10) )`


# 2. Second Session

1. Write a program that takes an input number and outputs the next multiple of 10 that is greater than the given number. For instance, if the input is 11, the program should print 20. If the input is 40, it should print 50.

2. Write a program that takes two input numbers and prints the larger number as the output. The first line of input should contain the first number, while the second line should contain the second number. The input numbers are guaranteed to be positive integers. If the two input numbers are equal, you can print either one of them.

3. Write a program that prompts the user to enter their age and prints their corresponding age group.

      - If the age is between zero and six (exclusive), the program should output "preschooler".
      - If the age is between six (inclusive) and ten (exclusive), the program should output "child".
      - If the age is between ten (inclusive) and fourteen (exclusive), the program should output "adolescent".
      - If the age is between fourteen (inclusive) and twenty-four (exclusive), the program should output "youth".
      - If the age is between twenty-four (inclusive) and forty (exclusive), the program should output "adult".
      - If the age is forty or above, the program should output "middle-aged".

4. Write a program that prompts the user to enter three numbers: A, B, and C. If A is even or both B and C are even, the program should print "good". Otherwise, it should print "bad". Try to achieve this using the OR and AND operators.

5. Write a program that prompts the user to enter four numbers and prints the maximum value among them.

6. Write a program that assists consumers in deciding whether to consume a food product based on the colors of the health guide labels. If a product meets the following conditions, print the message "Do not consume." Otherwise, print the message "Safe to consume":
      - It has at least three red labels.
      - It has at least two red labels and at least two yellow labels.
      - All labels are either yellow or red (meaning we don't have any green labels!).

# 3. Third Session

> **IMPORTANT**  
> The purpose of the exercises that require you to determine the output of a code is to encourage you to execute the code in your mind rather than relying on the Python interpreter.

1. What will the following Python program print out?

   ```
   def print_double(x):
         print(2 * x)
      
      
   print_double(3)
   ```

2. What will the following Python program print out?

   ```
   def shout(word):
         return word + "!"
      
      
   speak = shout
   output = speak("shout")
   print(output)
   ```

 3. What will the following Python program print out?

    ```
    def add(x, y):
          return x + y

 
    def do_twice(func, x, y):
          return func(func(x, y), func(x, y))


    a = 5
    b = 10

    print(do_twice(add, a, b))
    ```
     
4. Write a program that converts a student's numerical score into a corresponding letter grade (A-F) according to the following table.

   ```
   Score   Grade
   >= 18     A
   >= 16     B
   >= 14     C
   >= 12     D
   < 12     F
   ```

# 4. Fourth Session

1. Write a program that accepts an input number, n, calculates its factorial and displays the result.

   example input:
   ```
   5
   ```
   
   example output:  
   ```
   120
   ```


2. Please write a program that takes a positive number as input and determines whether it is a prime number or not.
   
   Definition of a prime number: It is only divisible by 1 and itself, with no other divisors. For example, 7 is a prime number because it    can only be divided by 1 and 7. However, 6 is not a prime number because it can be divided by 1, 2, 3, and 6.

   If the number is prime, output the word "prime." If the number is not prime, output the phrase "not prime."

   example input:
   ```
   32
   ```
   
   example output:  
   ```
   not prime
   ```

3. In this program, input the score achieved by Siah-gooshan team in the matches of the Premier League and print the total score of Siah-gooshan along with the number of victories they have obtained this season. Siah-gooshan plays 10 games in the Premier League, so the scores of this team will be provided to you in 10 lines. For each game, Siah-gooshan can gain zero, one, or three points. A loss corresponds to zero points, a draw corresponds to one point, and a win corresponds to three points.

   example input:
   ```
   1
   0
   3
   1
   1
   3
   0
   0
   3
   1
   ```

   example output:
   ```
   13 3
   ```


4. Write a program that reads the votes of candidates for TBZMED shoraye-senfi from the input and prints the highest and second-highest votes. The program will continue reading from the input until -1 is entered. Once -1 appears in the input, the program will stop reading and print the highest votes. It is guaranteed that the votes of the candidates in the input are unique (i.e., no two candidates will have the same votes).


   example input:
   ```
   173
   155
   396
   513
   148
   326
   289
   -1
   ```

   example output:
   ```
   513 396
   ```

5. Write a program that takes 20 numbers as input and, prints the number with the highest number of divisors along with the count of its divisors. If multiple numbers have the same highest divisor count, print the largest among them.

   One of the goals of the following question is to use functions. Feel free to write separate functions for specific parts of the code. For this question, create a function that takes a number as input and returns the count of its divisors. Then, incorporate this function into your program.

   example input:
   ```
   767
   665
   999
   895
   907
   796
   561
   914
   719
   819
   555
   529
   672
   933
   882
   869
   801
   660
   879
   985
   ```

   example output:
   ```
   672 24
   ```

# Fifth and Sixth Sessions: Data Structures and Methods

1. Write a program that reads 10 names from input and prints their standardized versions in alphabetical order as output. A standardized name is one that begins with a capital letter and the rest of the letters are lowercase.

   example input:
   ```
   BaHram
   MaHnaZ
   hooman
   FaribORZ
   barAN
   HedieH
   ALI
   EZATOLLAH
   MOHAMADALI
   JAMSHID
   ```

   example output:
   ```
   Ali
   Bahram
   Baran
   Ezatollah
   Fariborz
   Hedieh
   Hooman
   Jamshid
   Mahnaz
   Mohamadali
   ```

2. Write a program that prompts the user to input a string. The program should then check if the string contains the word "hello" while ignoring some letters. For example, if the user enters "hexxllo", the program should still detect "hello" by ignoring the extra "x" letters.

   example input:
   ```
   ahhellllloou
   ```
   
   example output:
   ```
   Yes
   ```

   example input:
   ```
   hlelo
   ```

   example output:
   ```
   No
   ```
   
   example input:
   ```
   pnnepelqomhhheollvlo
   ```

   example output:
   ```
   Yes
   ```


3. Write a program that checks if a word has more uppercase letters than lowercase letters. If so, it prints the word in all uppercase letters. Otherwise, it prints the word in all lowercase letters.

   Tip: Review string methods.

   example input:
   ```
   hasTAM
   ```

   example output:
   ```
   hastam
   ```

4. A palindrome is a word that reads the same backward as forward, such as "racecar" or "madam".

   Write a program that takes a word as input from the user and checks if it is a palindrome. The program should first remove any spaces and make the input lowercase.

   example input:
   ```
   Madam
   ```

   example output:
   ```
   Palindrome
   ```

   example input:
   ```
   University
   ```

   example output:
   ```
   not Palindrome
   ```

5. The specifications of n laptops are given to you. The first line of input contains the integer n which shows the number of laptops. Each of the next n lines contains two integers where the first integer shows the price of the laptop and the second integer shows its quality. If you can find two laptops where one has lower price but higher quality than the other, print "Nice!". Otherwise print "Bad!".

   example input:
   ```
   2
   1 10
   7 3
   ```

   example output:
   ```
   Nice!
   ```

   example input:
   ```
   4
   1 5
   7 9
   5 6
   20 30
   ```

   example output:
   ```
   Bad!
   ```

6. Write a program to check if AB and BA can be found in a string without overlapping each other. The order of AB and BA does not matter. For example, if the input is ABBA the answer is YES. If the input is BAAB the answer is still YES. But if the input is ABA the answer is NO. Or if the input is ABHA the answer is still NO.
