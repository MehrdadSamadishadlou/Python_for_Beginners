# 1. First Session

42 // 12
17 % 6
print('b'*2 + 'a'*1 + 'c'*3 )
```

1. What would the following code print?

1. Write a program that utilizes the input function to ask the user for their name, and then delivers a personalized welcome message as follows.

```
Enter your name: Mehrdad
Hello Mehrdad
```

4. Write a program that uses the input function to ask the user for the number of hours he/she worked and the hourly payment, and then calculates the gross pay based on this information.

```
Work Hours: 32
Enter Rate: 100000
Pay: 3200000
```
5. If we are sure that the variable 'num' is a two-digit number, which line of code would cause the output to be the reverse of the value of 'num'? (For example, if 'var' is equal to 23, the output would be 32.)

  a. `print( str(var // 10) + str(var % 10) )`
  
  b. `print( str(var % 10) + str(var // 10) )`
  
  c.`print( str(var / 10) + str(var % 10) )` 
  
  d.`print( str(var % 10) + str(var / 10) )`
